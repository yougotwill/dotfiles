# Amethyst Configuration

## Layouts

The `layouts` folder must be copied manually to the `Layouts` directory in `~/Library/Application Support/Amethyst`. This ensures that Amethyst can access and apply the custom layouts.

Use the following command to create the symlink:

```shell
cp -R ~/.config/amethyst/layouts ~/Library/Application\ Support/Amethyst/Layouts
```
